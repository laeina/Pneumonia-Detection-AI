# Pneumonia-Detection-AI

This project leverages AI models to detect pneumonia from X-ray images, focusing on improving model accuracy through field data and data augmentation techniques.

Overview
    What is Pneumonia? 
    A lung infection causing symptoms like cough and difficulty breathing, often diagnosed using X-ray imaging.
    Goal: 
    Develop a machine learning model to classify X-ray images as pneumonia-positive or negative with high accuracy.


Key Contributions
    - Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
    - Improved model accuracy on real-world, noisy field data by implementing data augmentation techniques.
    - Achieved an accuracy of ~64% on augmented field data.

Process
1. Data Preparation:
    - Collected X-ray images for training and testing.
    - Implemented data augmentation to simulate real-world conditions.
      
Model Training:
    - Trained using CNNs to classify images into pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative categories.

Evaluation:
    - Assessed performance on validation data.
    - Optimized using field data for robustness.

Ethical Considerations
    - Emphasized responsible AI use, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.
    - Considered implications of accuracy rates in high-stakes environments.

Results
    - Achieved 64% accuracy on field data, highlighting the challenges of generalizing AI models in healthcare.

Technologies Used
    - Programming Languages: Python
    - Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
